Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?

The distribution was fair. We pair programmed the API and worked together on the documentation.
I'd estimate that my grade for this project is around 90-95%.

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)


I estimate my grade for the course will be an A. I have completed all my assignments on time,
and I've consistently read through the lecture notes to ensure I was not falling behind. Even
though I had experience with web dev before this class, I changed my habits because I learned
the proper coding practices from watching the lecture videos and reading the slides.


3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?

Just a grade is okay.

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?

In my project proposal, I said I would implement a loyalty member sign in. I did not realize
until recently that seniors only have to implement one optional feature. So I've implemented
the ability for a user to purchase an item. Even though I don't have a cart view, the stock
is updated in the back end, so users can no longer purchase the same item. 

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?

You can share it anonymously.
